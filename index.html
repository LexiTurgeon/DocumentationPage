      <p id="intro_para">What is a computer? What makes a computer work? Well, you're in the right place to find out. A
        computer is a device that stores and processes information. Computers are used daily in many different
        environments. From software coding on them, to writing a novel on them, to even web browsing or playing games.

      <header id="about_header">About Computers</header>
      <p id="about_para">Since computers are used for many different applications, it has become common to fully
        customize them based on ther users needs. Computer customization is heavily seen in the gaming industry, but is
        also seen in other industries as well. For the purpose of this webpage, we will mainly discuss the common parts
        used in gaming computers.</p>

    <section class="main-section" id="Computer_Case">
      <header id="case_header">Computer Case</header>
      <p id="case_para">The computer case is the piece that holds all of the computer components together. It is meant
        to hold all of the wires and components in an easy to put together conifiguration, but also making the computer
        look tidy. The case is what is mainly seen of the computer (although some cases offer a tempered glass side
        panel so the components can be seen.) so there are many different colors and sizes of cases, the size case
        needed corresponds with the size motherboard that is used.</p>
      <li id="case_list"><b>Very Small Form Factor:</b> This form factor is the smallest form factor offered. This size
        form factor can create very compact, yet powerful computers. This option is great for someone who does not have
        a lot of space to give for a PC.</li>
      <li id="case_list"><b>Small Form Factor:</b> This form factor is a bit larger than Very Small Form Factor. The
        advantage to it being slightly bigger, is that there is more room to work with for configuration of cables,
        fans, lights, etc.</li>
      <li id="case_list"><b>Standard Form Factor:</b> This form factor offers much more space than the smaller form
        factors. It makes cable management much easier, and allows for even more room for configuration of cables, fans,
        lights, etc. With a bigger sized case like this, bigger sizes of other components such as GPU's and PSU's can be
        used.</li>
      <li id="case_list"><b>Larger Form Factor:</b> This form factor is the biggest size offered. Having a case this
        large allows for many more fans, bigger GPU's, better cable management, better airflow, etc. The more space to
        work with, the better.</li>

    <section class="main-section" id="Motherboard">
      <header id="motherboard_header">Motherboard</header>
      <p id="motherboard_para">The motherboard is what makes all the computer components work together. All components
        of the computer are plugged in to the motherboard. The motherboard is mounted with screws directly into the case
        of the computer. There are different sized motherboards (which is why there are different sized cases). Please
        note, these are not all of the sizes of motherboards available, but a well versed list to show there are
        different sizes.</p>
      <li id="motherboard_list"><b>Mini ITX:</b> This is the smallest sized motherboard. This small sized motherboard
        allows the whole computer system to fit in a ver small form factor case. The advantage to something like this is
        having a portable computer and one that is small enough to fit on small desks when space is a concern.</li>
      <li id="motherboard_list"><b>Micro ATX:</b> This motherboard is a bit bigger than the Mini ITX size. The advantage
        to this size increase is that there is more functionality on the motherboard. This functionality can be more RAM
        slots, additional PCIe slots, more SATA ports, etc. The difference in functionality additions depends on the
        manufacturer and even series of motherboard.</li>
      <li id="motherboard_list"><b>Standard ATX:</b> This motherboard is considered a "full size". It often has more
        than one PCIe ports, multiple slots for RAM, and plenty of SATA cable ports. This motherboard fits well in a
        standard form factor case.</li>
      <li id="motherboard_list"><b>XL ATX:</b> This is very similar to the standard ATX, but is still larger. This also
        usually has the most extra ports. It is common to have a motherboard like this to be able to support a larger,
        higher end CPU.</li>

      <header id="cpu_header">Central Processing Unit</header>
      <p id="cpu_para">The CPU is the brains of the computer. It processes all information that is sent through the
        computer. The CPU communicates with the RAM to take information from the RAM and process that information so
        that the tasks needed are performed. The CPU sits in a socket in the motherboard.</p>
      <p id="cpu_para">There are different brands of CPUs. The most popular being AMD and Intel. Within each of these
        manufacturers they make different tiers of processors. Each of these tiers have different performance and
        usages. Lets pick a tier from AMD for an example. AMD makes a series of processors called the Ryzen series.
        These processors are very common in gaming computers. The Ryzen series of processors come in different tiers of
        performance. There is a Ryzen 5, Ryzen 7, and Ryzen 9. Within each of these tiers are different variations of
        the processor, but we won't get that deep into it.</p>
      <p id="cpu_para">For the purpose of this webpage, just note that the CPU is the brain of the computer, and that
        the CPU can have different tiers of performance. Some CPUs being faster than others.</p>

      <p id="ram_para">The RAM is a type of storage for the computer to access to read and write extremely fast. RAM
        does not keep any data once the computer is powered off. The RAM works hand in hand with the CPU to provide it
        information to process. The RAM plugs into a slot that is generally next to the CPU on the motherboard.</p>
      <p id="ram_para">There are difference sizes of RAM that can be bought. There is 4GB, 8GB, 16GB, 32GB, 64GB, etc.
        The different sizes for capacity of memory it will use.</p>
